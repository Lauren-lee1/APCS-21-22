HW101 -- Heap o Trouble
2022-05-16
time spent: .5 hours

DISCO
    - We discovered that it doesn't matter if we insert left or right. Even if the tree looks like a linked list, it's technically a heap
    - The remove algo for a heap is similar to that for a BST in how it recurses

QCC
    - Is a linked list sorted in ascending order a min heap
