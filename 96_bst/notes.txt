DISCO
    - we can write recursive functions without parameters!
QCC
    - our understanding of height is that a one node tree is height 0 and a tree with two levels is of height 1 but the comment for the height() method says a one node tree is of height 0. Which is correct?
    - Is there a way to initialize a BST variable automatically takes the instance of BST in the class
      ie BST curr = this.BST(). Right now we have to create a new BST and set its root to our root which is an extra step
