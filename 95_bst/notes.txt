DISCO
    - There's only one unique tree for BST given a set of values
    -
QCC
    - How can we make it print to look like an actual tree
    - When objects are declared, they are declared as null, so why do we need to initialize the _root to null? (it works without initializing)
    - If a node is equal to another node, do you put it on the left or right, and which one should be the child or the parent. Does it matter?

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦
1. a perfect binary tree has 2^L - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^h nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceiling(log_2(n))
