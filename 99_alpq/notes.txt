DISCO
* ArrayList have overloaded remove() methods
  * remove(Object x) --> returns boolean
  * remove(int x) --> returns int

QCC
* When considering the run time complexity, are we considering the original method of ArrayList?
  * the worst case scenario for add() in an ArrayList is O(n) but when we call add() in ArrayPriorityQueue, add is O(1)
