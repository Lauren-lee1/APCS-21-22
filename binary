0. What does "base" in "base --x Number System" mean?
  The base in the base --x number system means that the number system will be built on the number x. Base signifies that the number system must be limited to a certain value in a digit. The value of each digit must be from 0 to (x-1). For example, the values of the digits in a base 2 number system are 0 to 1 (2-1). You will never see the number x as a digit in a base x number system. In the base 2 number system, you will never see the number 2 as a digit. 
  
1. What is binary and why do we, in computing, care?
  Binary is a base 2 number system and it is used by computers to store data. The reason computers use binary is because it is easy to store data using on and off switches called transitors which is efficient for circuits. The computer is limited to using 2 digits, so a base 2 number system is what it has to work with. It's also simpler than other number systems because it is easier to distinguish between on and off as opposed to on and off and a between value.
  
2. Express an algorithm for converting from binary to decimal
  1) Count the number of digits in the binary number
      ex. 101--> 3 digits
  2) For each digit, list out powers of 2 from 0 to the number of digits minus one. 
      ex. 2^0
          2^1
          2^2
  3) Multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2
