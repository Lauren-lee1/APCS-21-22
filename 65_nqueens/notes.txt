 * QCC:
 * The current solve method starts from the upper-leftmost corner of the board. Would it be possible to devise a solution that
 starts from another row in that leftmost column?

  * DISCO:
  * A wrapper class is a method that calls a helper method
  * simple is better
  * You can use recursion in a for loop
  * base case is when recursive call should end
