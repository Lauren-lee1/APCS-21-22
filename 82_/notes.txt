    DISCO
     * Nested class inherits all methods and instance variable of larger class
    QCC
     * Changing the addFirst() method significantly impacted our code

     public void addFirst( T newFirstVal )
     {
       //insert new node before first node (prev=null, next=_head)
       _head = new DLLNode<T>( newFirstVal, null, _head );

       if ( _size == 0 )
         _tail = _head;
       else
         _head.getNext().setPrev( _head );
       _size++;
     }

     --> works as given

     Though, if we decide to add {} to indicate start and end for if and else, we start losing elements to the void
     Why does adding {} significantly change our code functionality when its more of a stylistic choice?
