### What encourages me?
- My mother wanting to adopt TAQS and to throw me to the curb.

### Our Experience
Up to Activity 4 it was pretty understandable. Though we struggled a lot with activity four and how to fetch the data from the xml file. After we overcame that and the code compiled, we had trouble running it because of the error we found.

Error: Could not find or load main class Tennis
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Tennis

We weren't able to figure it out but we think we are pretty close.
