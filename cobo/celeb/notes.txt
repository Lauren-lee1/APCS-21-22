time spent: 5 hrs

DISCO
1. Attempting to execute a subclass file with no main method will instead execute the main method of the superclass (if applicable)
2. setContentPanel is good for changing screens
3. The play method doesn't reset the size of the array, so the reset button doesn't work as given

QCC
1. What the heck is low coupling?

Activity 1 -- Introduction to Celebrity
1. Game Class, Celebrity Class, Info Class
2. number of guesses, points
3. make a guess, check if correct, increment/decrement
4. all
5. Play calls upon guess on one celebrity until the correct answer is reached, play is continued to be called until the timer is up
6. Real World Object: Kevin Xiao
information: Asian, actor, good at math, good at every academic subject, coding hobby, math hobby, writing hobby, loud

Activity 2 -- The Celebrity Class: A Simple Version
1. Constructors create an instance of a class and may assign values to instance variables
2. They don't have a return type in the heading
3. A name and a clue
4. Methods to get and set the name and clue of the celeb.
7. We can create a constructor that takes no inputs and randomly selects a celebrity from an array
    public Celebrity(){
         int rand = (int)(Math.random()*7);
         _name = _celebs[rand];
         _clue = _clues[rand];
    }

Activity 3 -- Putting It All Together
1. JComponent:
Can change borders, can make custom properties, supports drag and drop, can change colors, can change opacity,
can change layout, can paint borders, can manage keybinds,
can detect mouse movement, mouse clicks, key inputs, changes to components
2. public ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
because there's no accessor method
3. private Celebrity gameCelebrity;
12. CelebrityGame
13. It knows what instance variables Celebrity has, but it can't access them

Activity 4 --

    - Specialty                         string
    - Ratemyteacher rating              double
    - gets and sets
    - toString

    - Followers on social media         int
    - Number of campaigns               int
    - Motive / topic of activism        string
    - gets and sets
    - toString

17. If there is another method with the same name and params in a superclass,
but with different functionality. Also you can look for an @Override

18. using super to construct an instance of the superclass using subclass variables

19. extends

20. the superclass method

Activity 5

1. Because we love APCS :)
2. We thought about what attributes and actions an APCS student would have. then we considered how mykolyk students are different

3. Mr K class
4.
Class: Mykolyk
Attributes:
  - double _hrsSpent
  - int _daysSinceGrassTouching
  - boolean _holidayMaths
  - String _SOTW
Methods:
    + mykolyk(boolean, int, double, int, boolean, String)
    + int takeTest(boolean)

Class: apcs
Attributes:
  - boolean _grade;
  - int _period;
  - String _teacher;
Methods:
+ apcs(boolean, int, String)
+ boolean getGrade()
+ int getPeriod()
+ String getTeacher()
+ void setGrade(boolean)
+ boolean switchePeriod(int)
+ boolean switchTeacher(String)
+ int takeTest(boolean)
+ boolean hasSenioritis()
+ boolean isLate()
5.   @Override
  public int takeTest(boolean study){
    if (_holidayMaths == true && _hrsSpent <= 0.5 && _daysSinceGrassTouching == 0 && _SOTW.equals("Ride or Die") && study){
      return 100;
    } else if(_holidayMaths == true && _hrsSpent <= 0.5 && study){
      return (int) (Math.random()*34 + 65);
    } else {
      return (int) (Math.random()*65);
    }
  }
it makes takingTest different in a mykolyk class compared to a generic apcs class
